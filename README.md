# She Was A Star...

Welcome to the repo!

This is a simple static website, allowing you to live the essense of a 'former celebrity' now living in the random state of your choosing.

This site has its origins here:

This is open source and now licensed! This site was built incredibly quickly and could definitely use some finesse. **PRs welcome!**

## Try out the source code

If you want to spin this up locally, since this is just a couple static web assets you can do this a number of ways. For myself, I utilize the 'serve' project (https://npmjs.com/package/serve), along with npx.

Some simple steps to run are:

1. Clone the repo down
2. Go into the project folder (`cd shewasastar/`)
3. `npx serve .`
